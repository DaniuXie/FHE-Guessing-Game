# 🧪 Local Testing Guide

## ✅ Quick Answer: YES, Everything Works!

All core functionality is intact. We only removed temporary documentation and `.bat` shortcut files. All npm scripts and code are fully functional.

## 🚀 How to Test Locally

### 1️⃣ Backend Testing (Smart Contracts)

#### Compile Contracts
```bash
npm run compile
```

#### Run Tests (if you have test files)
```bash
npm test
```

#### Deploy to Local Hardhat Network
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local node
npm run node

# Terminal 2: Deploy contracts
npm run deploy:local
```

#### Deploy to Sepolia Testnet
```bash
npm run deploy
```

#### Run Full Test Flow (on Sepolia)
```bash
npm run full-test
```

#### Game Management Scripts
```bash
# Create a new game
npm run create-game

# Join a game
npm run join-game

# End a game
npm run end-game
```

---

### 2️⃣ Frontend Testing (React App)

#### Start Development Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open: http://localhost:5173

#### Build for Production
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

#### Preview Production Build
```bash
cd frontend
npm run preview
```

## 🔧 Complete Testing Workflow

### Full Stack Local Test (Step by Step)

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Root dependencies
npm install

# Frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

**Step 2: Configure Environment**
```bash
# Copy the template and fill in your values
# Use ENV_TEMPLATE.txt as reference
# Create .env file with:
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.public.blastapi.io
```

**Step 3: Compile Contracts**
```bash
npm run compile
```

**Step 4: Deploy Contracts**
```bash
# Option A: Deploy to Sepolia (recommended)
npm run deploy

# Option B: Deploy to local Hardhat network
# Terminal 1:
npm run node

# Terminal 2:
npm run deploy:local
```

**Step 5: Update Frontend Config**
```bash
# Edit frontend/src/utils/constants.ts
# Update contract addresses from deployment output
```

**Step 6: Start Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Step 7: Test in Browser**
- Open http://localhost:5173
- Connect MetaMask
- Switch to Sepolia network
- Create a game
- Join a game
- Test full flow

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Test that everything works:

- [ ] `npm install` runs successfully
- [ ] `npm run compile` compiles contracts
- [ ] `npm run deploy` deploys to Sepolia
- [ ] `cd frontend && npm install` installs frontend deps
- [ ] `cd frontend && npm run dev` starts dev server
- [ ] Frontend opens at http://localhost:5173
- [ ] MetaMask connects successfully
- [ ] Can create a game
- [ ] Can join a game
- [ ] Can view game details

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module not found"
```bash
# Solution: Reinstall dependencies
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
```

### Issue: "Cannot find .env file"
```bash
# Solution: Create .env from template
# Use ENV_TEMPLATE.txt as reference
```

### Issue: "Contract not deployed"
```bash
# Solution: Deploy contracts first
npm run deploy
# Then update frontend/src/utils/constants.ts with addresses
```

### Issue: "Port already in use"
```bash
# Solution: Change port in vite.config.ts or kill process
# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or just use a different port
cd frontend
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

## ✅ Summary

**Everything you need for testing is intact:**

✅ All smart contracts  
✅ All deployment scripts  
✅ All testing scripts  
✅ Complete frontend application  
✅ All configuration files  
✅ All npm commands  

**What changed:**
- ❌ Removed 100+ temporary documentation files
- ❌ Removed .bat shortcut files (they were just wrappers around npm commands)

**Bottom line:** 
🎉 **Your project works exactly as before!** You can test, develop, and deploy normally.

The cleanup only made the repository **cleaner and more professional** for GitHub, without affecting any functionality.

**Happy Testing!** 🚀
